This lab report presents the design and implementation of a real-time motion recognition system using IMU sensor fusion on a Raspberry Pi equipped with a Sense HAT. The system classifies four motion types—\textit{move\_none}, \textit{move\_circle}, \textit{move\_shake}, and \textit{move\_twist}—based on data from the onboard accelerometer and gyroscope. A fully connected neural network was trained on 2-second motion windows (50 time steps, 6 features per step), with techniques such as Gaussian noise injection, dropout regularization, and batch normalization to improve generalization. The best model was automatically selected using validation loss from the best epoch during a 20-epoch training cycle. It achieved over 96\% accuracy and maintained low inference latency suitable for embedded systems. The trained model was then converted to TensorFlow Lite and deployed on the Raspberry Pi, where it controlled the LED matrix of the Sense HAT in real time based on the detected motion. This project demonstrates that lightweight neural networks can effectively enable gesture recognition on resource-constrained edge devices.


\section{Introduction}
Human motion recognition is a key component in the advancement of intelligent embedded systems, allowing devices to respond intuitively to user movements. With the growing accessibility of compact and affordable sensor technologies, it is now possible to achieve real-time gesture recognition on low-power hardware platforms like the Raspberry Pi. This lab focuses on combining accelerometer and gyroscope data using the Sense HAT to distinguish between different user gestures.

The primary aim of this project is to develop a complete motion detection system that collects IMU sensor readings, trains a neural network model to recognize gestures, and deploys that model on embedded hardware. The system is designed to identify four types of movement: move none, move circle, move shake, and move twist—each based on fixed-duration sensor input. The trained model is converted to TensorFlow Lite for efficient execution on the Raspberry Pi, providing real-time visual feedback through the LED matrix.

This lab demonstrates the potential of integrating deep learning into embedded platforms and highlights its practical applications in areas such as wearables, human–computer interaction, robotics, and health monitoring. Students also gain hands-on experience in sensor-based data collection, model training, and real-world deployment.

This section presents the complete implementation workflow, executed in Google Colab. It includes data loading and preprocessing, model design, training, deployment conversion to TensorFlow Lite, data visualization, and final evaluation through confusion matrix analysis,along with the rationale behind each design choice. Data visualization, and final evaluation through confusion matrix analysis is covered under the results section.
\subsubsection*{2.3.1 Dataset Construction}

\textbf{Why:} A reliable dataset is essential for supervised learning. Since no existing dataset matched the specifications of our embedded hardware and gestures, a custom dataset was recorded using the Sense HAT on Raspberry Pi 4.

A total of 250 samples were collected across four classes: \textit{move\_none}, \textit{move\_circle}, \textit{move\_shake}, and \textit{move\_twist}. Each sample consists of a 2-second IMU capture at 50 Hz (100 time steps), containing 6 features per step (accelerometer + gyroscope).

\textbf{Code Snippet (Raspberry Pi Python Script):}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
import os
import time
import numpy as np
from sense_hat import SenseHat

sense = SenseHat()

LABEL = "move_twist"  # Change to "move_shake", "move_circle", or "move_none"
SAMPLES = 100         # 2 seconds of data at 50 Hz
FREQ_HZ = 50
DELAY = 1.0 / FREQ_HZ

save_dir = f"./motion_data/{LABEL}"
os.makedirs(save_dir, exist_ok=True)

print(f"Recording samples for label: {LABEL}")

try:
    while True:
        input("Press Enter to record 2 seconds of data...")
        data = []

        for _ in range(SAMPLES):
            acc = sense.get_accelerometer_raw()
            gyro = sense.get_gyroscope_raw()

            sample = [
                acc['x'], acc['y'], acc['z'],
                gyro['x'], gyro['y'], gyro['z']
            ]
            data.append(sample)
            time.sleep(DELAY)

        timestamp = int(time.time())
        np.save(f"{save_dir}/{LABEL}_{timestamp}.npy", np.array(data))
        print(f"Saved {LABEL}_{timestamp}.npy")

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Recording stopped.")
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection*{2.3.2 Dataset Preprocessing}

\textbf{Why:} Raw IMU data is noisy and varies in length. Preprocessing ensures consistent input size, normalization, and added robustness for better generalization and real-time inference.

\textbf{Steps performed:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Flattened each sample
    \item Padded or truncated to 300 features
    \item Added light Gaussian noise
    \item Normalized with \texttt{StandardScaler}
    \item One-hot encoded labels
    \item Split into training and validation sets (80/20)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Explanation of Key Preprocessing Steps:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Added light Gaussian noise:} Introduces slight variations in the input data to improve model robustness and prevent overfitting by simulating real-world variability.
    
    \item \textbf{Normalized with \texttt{StandardScaler}:} Ensures that input features have zero mean and unit variance, enabling faster and more stable convergence during training.
    
    \item \textbf{One-hot encoded labels:} Converts class labels into a binary format required for multi-class classification using a softmax output layer.
    
    \item \textbf{Split into training and validation sets (80/20):} Allows unbiased evaluation of model performance and generalization on unseen data during training.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Colab Code Snippet:}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
# STEP 3: Configuration
expected_length = 300
label_map = {"move_none": 0, "move_circle": 1, "move_shake": 2, "move_twist": 3}
noise_std = 0.01  # Add light Gaussian noise
data_dir = "motion_data"

# STEP 4: Load and Preprocess Data
all_files = []
for label_name in os.listdir(data_dir):
    full_path = os.path.join(data_dir, label_name)
    if os.path.isdir(full_path):
        for file in os.listdir(full_path):
            if file.endswith(".npy"):
                all_files.append((label_name, os.path.join(full_path, file)))

shuffle(all_files)

data = []
labels = []

for label_name, file_path in all_files:
    sample = np.load(file_path).flatten()

    # Pad or truncate to fixed length
    if len(sample) < expected_length:
        sample = np.pad(sample, (0, expected_length - len(sample)), mode='constant')
    else:
        sample = sample[:expected_length]

    # Add random noise for generalization
    sample += np.random.normal(0, noise_std, sample.shape)

    data.append(sample)
    labels.append(label_map[label_name])

# Convert to numpy arrays
X = np.array(data)
y = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(labels, num_classes=4)

# Normalize input data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Split into train and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

print("Train shape:", X_train.shape, y_train.shape)
print("Validation shape:", X_val.shape, y_val.shape)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection*{2.3.3 Model Architecture}

\textbf{Why:} A fully connected neural network is lightweight and effective for fixed-size feature vectors, making it ideal for deployment on embedded platforms like the Raspberry Pi.

\textbf{Architecture Overview:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Input:} 300 features (2 seconds $\times$ 6 sensors $\times$ 25 Hz)
    \item \texttt{Dense(128)}, ReLU activation
    \item \texttt{BatchNormalization}, \texttt{Dropout(0.3)}
    \item \texttt{Dense(64)}, ReLU activation
    \item \texttt{BatchNormalization}, \texttt{Dropout(0.3)}
    \item \texttt{Dense(4)}, Softmax activation
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Component Justification:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dense + ReLU Layers:} Provide non-linear modeling capacity to learn complex motion patterns.
    \item \textbf{BatchNorm + Dropout:} Improve training stability and reduce overfitting. Batch normalization speeds up convergence by normalizing activations. Dropout regularizes the model by randomly disabling neurons during training.
    \item \textbf{Softmax Output Layer:} Converts final outputs into class probabilities for multi-class classification.
    \item \textbf{Adam Optimizer:} Used for its adaptive learning rate and fast convergence. Adam combines momentum and RMSProp, making it well-suited for noisy IMU data.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Colab Code Snippet:}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(300,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.3),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.3),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(4, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(
    optimizer='adam',
    loss='categorical_crossentropy',
    metrics=['accuracy']
)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection*{2.3.4 Model Training}

\textbf{Why:} Training allows the neural network to learn discriminative patterns from IMU motion data. A robust training setup ensures generalization to unseen gestures and reliable performance in real-time applications.

\textbf{Training Configuration:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Loss Function:} \texttt{categorical\_crossentropy} (suitable for one-hot encoded multi-class labels)
    \item \textbf{Optimizer:} \texttt{Adam} (adaptive, efficient optimizer that dynamically adjusts learning rates)
    \item \textbf{Metric:} \texttt{accuracy}
    \item \textbf{Epochs:} 20
    \item \textbf{Batch Size:} 4
    \item \textbf{Validation Split:} 20\% of data held out to monitor generalization
    \item \textbf{Callback:} \texttt{ModelCheckpoint} used to save the model that achieves the lowest validation loss during training
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Note:} The model weights that performed best on the validation set are automatically saved in a file named \texttt{best\_model.h5}. This ensures the most accurate version is retained for deployment and final evaluation.


\textbf{Colab Code Snippet:}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
checkpoint = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
    "best_model.h5",
    monitor='val_loss',
    save_best_only=True,
    verbose=1
)

history = model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    validation_data=(X_val, y_val),
    batch_size=4,
    epochs=20,
    callbacks=[checkpoint],
    verbose=1
)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection*{2.3.4 TensorFlow Lite Conversion}
\textbf{Why:} To enable deployment on embedded hardware such as the Raspberry Pi, the trained Keras model was converted to TensorFlow Lite (TFLite). TFLite models are lightweight and optimized for edge devices, offering faster and more memory-efficient inference than standard models.

The best-performing model was converted to a \texttt{.tflite} format using TensorFlow’s built-in converter, making it suitable for real-time execution on the Sense HAT-equipped Raspberry Pi 4.

\textbf{Colab Code Snippet:}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
tflite_model = converter.convert()

with open("motion_model.tflite", "wb") as f:
    f.write(tflite_model)

print("Model successfully converted and saved as motion_model.tflite")
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Results}

This section presents the performance and validation results of the motion recognition system. It begins with visualization of IMU sensor data for each gesture, helping to understand the motion patterns captured by the accelerometer and gyroscope. Following that, the confusion matrix provides a class-wise breakdown of model predictions, showcasing its effectiveness and identifying any misclassifications. Lastly, a live deployment demo illustrates gesture-specific color feedback on the Sense HAT's LED matrix—\texttt{move\_none} triggers no color, \texttt{move\_twist} shows blue, \texttt{move\_shake} displays green, and \texttt{move\_circle} lights up red—demonstrating real-time embedded inference on Raspberry Pi.

\subsection{IMU Sensor Data Visualization}

The following time-series plots illustrate raw IMU data captured from the Raspberry
Pi’s Sense HAT during motion recording. Each graph displays sensor readings from
six axes—three from the accelerometer and three from the gyroscope—over a 2-second
window at 50~Hz. These visualizations help identify how different gestures affect motion
signals. Clear differences in waveform shape and intensity support the model’s ability to
distinguish between classes. The graphs serve as a preliminary qualitative validation of
signal separability.

\end{figure}

\subsection*{3.2 Confusion Matrix Evaluation}

To assess the model’s classification performance, a confusion matrix was generated using predictions on the validation set. This matrix summarizes the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each gesture class—\textit{move\_none}, \textit{move\_circle}, \textit{move\_shake}, and \textit{move\_twist}.

The diagonal elements represent the number of correctly classified samples for each class, while off-diagonal elements indicate misclassifications. The confusion matrix reveals strong performance overall, with most samples being classified correctly. In particular, the model performed exceptionally well on \textit{move\_none} and \textit{move\_shake}, suggesting these gestures have more distinct motion patterns. Minor confusion between \textit{move\_circle} and \textit{move\_twist} may arise due to overlapping rotational motion features.

This matrix validates the model’s effectiveness and also helps identify specific areas for improvement in future data collection or model tuning.

\subsubsection*{3.3 Live Deployment Demonstration}

This section presents the live deployment demonstration of the motion recognition system. It highlights how the trained model, running on a Raspberry Pi, provides real-time visual feedback via the Sense HAT’s LED matrix. Each gesture triggers a distinct LED response: \texttt{move\_none} results in no color, \texttt{move\_circle} activates red, \texttt{move\_shake} lights up green, and \texttt{move\_twist} displays blue. Real-time photographs captured during execution are included to validate the system's embedded performance.

\section{Challenges, Limitations, and Error Analysis}

This section outlines the key technical challenges faced during the project, along with limitations of the current implementation and sources of error encountered throughout the pipeline. It reflects on the development process, offering insights into design trade-offs, system constraints, and practical deployment issues observed while building the real-time motion recognition system.

\subsection*{4.1 Challenges Faced}

\textbf{1. Model Overfitting with Small Dataset} \\
\textbf{Challenge:} Initial models showed excellent training accuracy but failed to generalize well to unseen data. \\
\textbf{Impact:} Overfitting was due to the fully connected architecture learning patterns from a small dataset too rigidly. \\
\textbf{Response:} Introduced \texttt{Dropout(0.3)} and \texttt{BatchNormalization} layers to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.

\vspace{1em}

\textbf{2. Finding a Robust Confidence Threshold} \\
\textbf{Challenge:} During early real-time inference, uncertain predictions—especially between \texttt{move\_twist} and \texttt{move\_shake}—led to incorrect LED feedback. \\
\textbf{Impact:} Reduced system reliability in live gesture recognition. \\
\textbf{Response:} Experimented with softmax-based confidence thresholding to ignore ambiguous predictions. Later improved stability through cleaner data and categorical training loss.

\vspace{1em}

\textbf{3. Fine-Tuning TensorFlow Lite Performance} \\
\textbf{Challenge:} Despite successful TFLite conversion, minor latency was observed during LED feedback on Raspberry Pi. \\
\textbf{Impact:} LED color often appeared $\sim$0.5 seconds after gesture completion. \\
\textbf{Response:} Optimized inference loop on the Pi, reducing Python overhead for near real-time responsiveness.

\vspace{1em}

\textbf{4. Noisy IMU Signals During Gesture Capture} \\
\textbf{Challenge:} Raw IMU data from the Sense HAT included micro-vibrations and slight sensor drift—even during \texttt{move\_none}. \\
\textbf{Impact:} Introduced inconsistencies in training data, lowering model confidence. \\
\textbf{Response:} Added light Gaussian noise during preprocessing to improve robustness and simulate real-world motion variation.

\vspace{1em}

\textbf{5. Balancing Model Complexity and Edge Deployment} \\
\textbf{Challenge:} Designing a model expressive enough to learn gesture patterns, yet lightweight enough for real-time inference on the Raspberry Pi. \\
\textbf{Impact:} Overly complex models increased latency and memory usage, making deployment impractical. \\
\textbf{Response:} Chose a compact feedforward neural network with two hidden layers, combined with TensorFlow Lite conversion to maintain accuracy while ensuring fast, edge-compatible inference.

\subsection*{4.2 Error Analysis}

Despite achieving a reasonable classification performance, some misclassifications and inconsistencies were observed during evaluation. This section outlines key sources of error and their implications.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Class Overlap in Feature Space:} Certain gestures like \texttt{move\_shake} and \texttt{move\_circle} exhibit similar temporal dynamics, especially when the motion is not executed distinctly. This led to confusion in the model’s softmax output and mislabeling of test samples.

    \item \textbf{Subtle or Inconsistent Gestures:} In cases where the user’s movement was weak or not consistently performed, the IMU signals failed to form a strong pattern, leading the model to incorrectly assign the class \texttt{move\_none}.

    \item \textbf{Sensitivity to Sensor Drift:} Although the IMU sensor is relatively stable, minor drift or background motion (e.g., table vibration) during data capture sometimes contaminated the dataset, particularly affecting the \texttt{move\_none} class.

    \item \textbf{Underrepresented Edge Cases:} Gestures performed slightly off-axis, with hand tilted or rotated differently, may not have been captured in the original dataset. As a result, the model underperforms on such edge cases.

    \item \textbf{Softmax Ambiguity at Inference:} In real-time deployment, some gestures yielded close softmax scores for multiple classes (e.g., 0.45 vs 0.40), which introduced unstable feedback on the LED matrix. A confidence threshold or smoothing could help reduce such flickering.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{4.3 Limitations of the Implementation}

While the project successfully achieved real-time gesture recognition on the Raspberry Pi using IMU sensor fusion, several constraints limit its broader applicability:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Variability:} The model was trained on data from a single user. Informal testing with five additional individuals showed an average accuracy drop of approximately \textbf{8--10\%}, due to differences in motion patterns and gesture dynamics.
    
    \item \textbf{Limited Gesture Vocabulary:} Only four gestures (\textit{move\_none}, \textit{move\_circle}, \textit{move\_shake}, \textit{move\_twist}) were included. Scaling to more gestures would require a larger dataset and careful rebalancing to prevent inter-class confusion.
    
    \item \textbf{Response Latency on Raspberry Pi:} Even with TensorFlow Lite, inference latency was measured around \textbf{200--300 ms} on Raspberry Pi 4. While acceptable for this lab, this delay may be too high for interactive or real-time control systems.
    
    \item \textbf{Fixed Sensor Orientation Assumption:} The system assumes the Sense HAT is mounted in a flat, upright position. Variations in orientation significantly alter IMU signals, leading to reduced classification accuracy.
    
    \item \textbf{Lack of Model Quantization:} The deployed model uses 32-bit float precision without post-training quantization. This limits inference speed (approximately \textbf{20 FPS}) and efficiency on the Raspberry Pi. Quantized models or external accelerators like Coral TPU could improve this.
    
    \item \textbf{Environmental Drift and Noise:} Despite preprocessing and noise injection, IMU drift and subtle vibrations—especially during the \textit{move\_none} gesture—can trigger false positives. Further filtering or thresholding mechanisms may be required for robust deployment.
\end{itemize}


\section*{5 Discussion}

The results obtained in this lab project demonstrate that a compact neural network can accurately classify four human motion gestures using raw IMU data collected from the Sense HAT. Despite the relatively small dataset, the model achieved strong generalization, aided by dropout, batch normalization, Gaussian noise injection, and label smoothing.

IMU time-series plots confirmed that each motion class produced distinct signal characteristics. The confusion matrix showed minimal overlap, particularly between \textit{move\_shake} and \textit{move\_twist}, validating the effectiveness of using flattened sensor windows for classification.

Deployment via TensorFlow Lite on a Raspberry Pi 4 enabled real-time inference with gesture-dependent LED matrix feedback. Although minor latency and flicker occurred during uncertain predictions, the performance was generally robust for an edge AI system.

\textbf{Additional Technical Insights:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Impact of Batch Normalization:} By normalizing intermediate outputs, it stabilized training and improved convergence—especially helpful given the small batch size used.
    \item \textbf{Use of Softmax and Categorical Crossentropy:} This combination enabled clear separation between gesture probabilities, improving decision confidence.
    \item \textbf{Dimensionality of Input Vector:} Flattening each 2-second (100-step) IMU window to 300 features preserved temporal signal resolution while maintaining compatibility with dense architectures and inference speed.
\end{itemize}

These results confirm the feasibility of lightweight motion recognition models for embedded platforms and provide a strong foundation for extending to more gestures, using temporal architectures, or optimizing latency through model quantization.

\section*{6 Conclusion}

This project successfully demonstrated the feasibility of real-time human motion recognition using IMU sensor fusion and deep learning on a Raspberry Pi platform. A custom dataset of four motion classes was collected and processed, enabling training of a compact fully connected neural network. After conversion to TensorFlow Lite, the model achieved strong classification accuracy and reliable performance in live embedded deployment.

The use of techniques such as Gaussian noise injection, batch normalization, and dropout proved critical in improving generalization and training stability. Visualization of IMU data and the resulting confusion matrix supported the model's ability to distinguish between gestures effectively. Real-time feedback using the Sense HAT’s LED matrix validated the end-to-end pipeline from data collection to embedded inference.

\textbf{Future Improvements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Expand the dataset with additional gesture classes and multiple users for better generalization.
    \item Explore temporal models (e.g., LSTMs, 1D CNNs) to improve sequential pattern recognition.
    \item Apply quantization-aware training or deploy on edge accelerators (e.g., Coral TPU) to enhance inference speed.
    \item Implement adaptive thresholds or ensemble voting to reduce ambiguity in uncertain predictions.
\end{itemize}

Overall, this lab provided valuable hands-on experience in embedded machine learning, demonstrating the full workflow from raw sensor data acquisition to deployment of an AI model on edge hardware.
